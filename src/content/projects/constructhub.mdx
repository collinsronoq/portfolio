## Overview
ConstructHub is a web-based system designed to streamline construction planning in Kenya by integrating cost estimation, technician discovery, and project guidance.

## Problem
Builders often face:
- Unreliable budgeting
- Limited visibility into skilled technicians
- Fragmented material pricing information
- Weak planning workflows that cause cost overruns

## Solution
Key capabilities:
- Cost estimation engine with structured phases
- Project creation workflows and summaries
- Technician directory (verification-ready)
- Admin-managed knowledge/articles module (optional)

## Architecture
- Frontend: React/TypeScript
- Backend: FastAPI
- Data: SQLAlchemy + PostgreSQL/SQLite
- Modules: estimation, auth, content, technicians, vendors

## Challenges and Learnings
- Designing estimation inputs to stay realistic and usable
- Keeping modules decoupled while still consistent
- Building for Kenyan context (materials, workflows, costs)

## Next Improvements
- Vendor verification + dynamic pricing feeds
- More standardized estimation templates
- Improved reporting exports (PDF/CSV)
